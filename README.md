# Weather Modeling using Quadratic Equation

This project implements a basic weather model simulation using the quadratic formula.  
The solution is implemented in three stages:
- Hardcoded inputs
- Keyboard input
- Reading input from a file (input.txt)

## Usage
- Run `weather_model.py`
- If reading from file, make sure `input.txt` is in the same directory.

## Example input (in input.txt)
